Examples
========

In addition to this section, you can find a 
`dedicated GitHub repository <https://github.com/yupidevs/yupi_examples/>`_
hosting code examples and additional multimedia resources required to use them.
You may want to clone that repository first in order to easily reproduce the
results shown in this section.

Examples are designed to illustrate a complex integration of yupi tools in 
order to reproduce the results of an existing (or yet to come) scientific paper. 
Before start with the examples make sure you have already read our Getting Started section.
